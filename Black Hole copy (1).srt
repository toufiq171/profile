00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
SEUM:
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,320
SEUM:
This is the first podcast about
Black Hole.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,839
SEUM:
I wanted to create an entire

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,279
SEUM:
series about the extreme object

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,359
SEUM:
of the universe, and I cannot

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,480
SEUM:
think anything but the black

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,320
SEUM:
hole first.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,928
SEUM:
Uh, whenever got access to

9
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,368
SEUM:
internet and I heard the black

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,048
SEUM:
hole concept, I was totally

11
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:30,169
SEUM:
obsessed with learning this

12
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,309
SEUM:
object.

13
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:36,109
SEUM:
And it's kind of a lot of
mystery to me, that moment.

14
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:39,948
SEUM:
And this is the topic that got

15
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:42,228
SEUM:
me into the whole astrophysics

16
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:43,069
SEUM:
thing.

17
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:47,588
SEUM:
I watched countless documentary
on astrophysics and read many

18
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:53,509
SEUM:
articles, but it's all started
this on topic black hole.

19
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,149
SEUM:
So today I want to talk about
it.

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,789
SEUM:
And before diving into the main

21
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,009
SEUM:
topic, I want you consider that

22
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,549
SEUM:
I'm not a native speaker in

23
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,069
SEUM:
English.

24
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,549
SEUM:
Um, I might make many

25
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,349
SEUM:
grammatical or probably lots of

26
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,198
SEUM:
grammatical mistakes And I'll

27
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,198
SEUM:
probably sometimes run out of

28
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,278
SEUM:
words.

29
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,519
SEUM:
Something like happens like this

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,379
SEUM:
that I sometimes I feel, um,

31
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,039
SEUM:
some feels feel the concept, but

32
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,399
SEUM:
I don't, I don't feel the word

33
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:28,039
SEUM:
for it.

34
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,399
SEUM:
So I might stumble there.

35
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,379
SEUM:
So please consider that I'm a
very beginner at this, and I

36
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:39,918
SEUM:
hope I'll get better at this
with each iteration.

37
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:43,759
SEUM:
And with that being said, let's
talk about Black Hole.

38
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,039
SEUM:
Black hole is the object in the
universe that its gravitational

39
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,718
SEUM:
pull is so strong that not even
light can escape.

40
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:57,399
SEUM:
For every massive object or any
object that has a mass has a

41
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,799
SEUM:
gravitational pull towards it
due to the gravitational pull.

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,838
SEUM:
To escape its velocity, you have

43
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,438
SEUM:
to have some amount of escape

44
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:07,679
SEUM:
velocity.

45
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,718
SEUM:
For example, our Earth has

46
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,419
SEUM:
eleven kilometers per second

47
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,558
SEUM:
escape velocity.

48
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,359
SEUM:
So if you throw an object with

49
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,778
SEUM:
this speed, it's going to go

50
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:23,459
SEUM:
outside of the Earth's

51
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,799
SEUM:
gravitational field.

52
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,368
SEUM:
And if you keep increasing the
mass of the object.

53
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:34,008
SEUM:
This velocity will keep
increasing.

54
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,288
SEUM:
So what happens when you put the

55
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:41,088
SEUM:
mass above the amount When the

56
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,248
SEUM:
when the escape velocity is

57
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,929
SEUM:
equivalent to the speed of

58
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,209
SEUM:
light.

59
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,169
SEUM:
That's when nothing can escape
from its gravitational pull.

60
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,889
SEUM:
But as the highest speed of any

61
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,209
SEUM:
object in our universe can be

62
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,788
SEUM:
occupied as the speed of light,

63
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,949
SEUM:
so nothing can escape from the

64
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,028
SEUM:
gravitational pull of this

65
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:05,968
SEUM:
object.

66
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:09,649
SEUM:
The formation of black hole is
whenever when a massive star

67
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,128
SEUM:
collapses under its own gravity.

68
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,248
SEUM:
To give you an overview.

69
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:20,209
SEUM:
Any type of star has a massive
gravity, and that gravity is,

70
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:26,088
SEUM:
um, cancelled by the outer
thermal energy push, and that

71
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:31,609
SEUM:
thermal energy is produced by
the fusion reaction at its core.

72
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,729
SEUM:
Um, for example, our sun uses

73
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,709
SEUM:
hydrogen to helium fusion to

74
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,049
SEUM:
produce that energy so that it

75
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,169
SEUM:
can counteract the inward

76
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,729
SEUM:
gravitational pull.

77
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,878
SEUM:
And when at its core, burns out
the hydrogen, it is going to

78
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,508
SEUM:
burn helium, and each stage it
produces more energy and

79
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,769
SEUM:
sun(star) will get puffed, when
A star runs out of hydrogen,

80
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,568
SEUM:
then it uses helium, and then it
uses carbon, and then it uses

81
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:08,229
SEUM:
oxygen, and then it uses
silicon, and then finally it

82
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,528
SEUM:
burns the silicon, which means
fuses the silicon to, produces,

83
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:15,049
SEUM:
uh, some type of metal.

84
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,168
SEUM:
And there is a kind of
transition transition element.

85
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,369
SEUM:
And that transition element
produces the iron.

86
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:28,619
SEUM:
And this iron is interesting
because when iron fuses it is no

87
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,338
SEUM:
longer an exothermic reaction.

88
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,538
SEUM:
It's an endothermic reaction.

89
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:37,199
SEUM:
So the combination of two iron

90
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,778
SEUM:
atom is no longer producing

91
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,778
SEUM:
energy.

92
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:47,278
SEUM:
And you you you need it to
needed that energy to counteract

93
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:48,899
SEUM:
the gravitational pull.

94
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,978
SEUM:
The massive gravitational pull
of the sun or a star.

95
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,319
SEUM:
So push is no longer provided.

96
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,199
SEUM:
And and the star kind of puffy

97
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,418
SEUM:
because I already mentioned

98
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,238
SEUM:
it's, it's it's in a form of red

99
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,319
SEUM:
giant.

100
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,499
SEUM:
So all of a sudden the star

101
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,778
SEUM:
star's outer layers kind of

102
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,559
SEUM:
collapses without any outward

103
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,459
SEUM:
push.

104
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:21,759
SEUM:
So and it's collapses and, uh,
at the core is the rigid iron

105
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,189
SEUM:
iron core and all the layers
kind of bounces back to that

106
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,149
SEUM:
rigid iron core.

107
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:31,108
SEUM:
And that's when the supernova
happens.

108
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:34,668
SEUM:
Most of the mass of the star is

109
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,749
SEUM:
literally thrown away at the

110
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:37,749
SEUM:
supernova.

111
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:42,488
SEUM:
And if the remnant of mass is
greater than the one point four

112
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,088
SEUM:
times the solar mass.

113
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,408
SEUM:
Then electron degeneracy
pressure also fails.

114
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:49,709
SEUM:
Proton and electron recombine to

115
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,749
SEUM:
create neutron, and all the star

116
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,928
SEUM:
kind of creates the pool full of

117
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:56,728
SEUM:
neutrons.

118
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:59,009
SEUM:
So, the neutron star forms.

119
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,689
SEUM:
But if the remnant of the star
is more massive than even two

120
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,829
SEUM:
point two solar masses, the
neutron degeneracy pressure no

121
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,069
SEUM:
longer also holds.

122
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,749
SEUM:
So it kind of collapses under
its own gravity.

123
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,949
SEUM:
And that's when the black hole
forms.

124
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,988
SEUM:
Now we know that how black hole
forms, how do we detect the

125
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:26,348
SEUM:
black hole if it's totally dark
or kind of, um, as by

126
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:30,468
SEUM:
definition, black hole, not even
light can escape.

127
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,428
SEUM:
So how do we detect it?

128
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,509
SEUM:
So one of the thing is that we

129
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,309
SEUM:
use to detect it is the

130
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,668
SEUM:
accretion disk.

131
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:44,588
SEUM:
When a black hole engulf any
other star and sucks its matter

132
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:49,908
SEUM:
into it, some of the matter
actually, um, actually gets into

133
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:55,108
SEUM:
its orbit and almost, almost
gets the speed of light, uh,

134
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:56,449
SEUM:
speed and heats up.

135
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,699
SEUM:
And the disk due to the heat it
radiates the light from it.

136
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,819
SEUM:
It radiates electromagnetic
radiation, visible, infrared,

137
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,538
SEUM:
and even x ray.

138
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:10,298
SEUM:
So and they're using that
radiation.

139
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:14,019
SEUM:
We can detect that there is a
black hole at its center.

140
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,939
SEUM:
From the center there is nothing
emitting.

141
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,139
SEUM:
And from the accretion disk
there is light producing.

142
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,678
SEUM:
And another thing we also use to

143
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,019
SEUM:
detect the black hole is the

144
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,699
SEUM:
particular movement of nearby

145
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,738
SEUM:
star.

146
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:35,019
SEUM:
if the star is moving a
particular orbit, we can use

147
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:39,959
SEUM:
many star orbit to figure out
how much the mass required that

148
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,999
SEUM:
point to create a, to create a
kind of that, much that amount

149
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,598
SEUM:
of gravitational pull where the
star is rotating that way.

150
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,968
SEUM:
And with that kind of, um,
mathematics.

151
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,369
SEUM:
Probably the Kepler's law.

152
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:56,488
SEUM:
We can figure out the mass

153
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,009
SEUM:
required into the core, into the

154
00:07:59,009 --> 00:07:59,728
SEUM:
center.

155
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,689
SEUM:
And from that also, we can

156
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,249
SEUM:
detect that there is a massive

157
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,088
SEUM:
object inside, and that massive

158
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:11,088
SEUM:
object can be only be the black

159
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:11,329
SEUM:
hole.

160
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:16,728
SEUM:
So that's how we can also figure
out the black hole's position.

161
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:21,509
SEUM:
For example, we find out the
Sagittarius A by the particular

162
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,788
SEUM:
movements of the star, uh, at
the core of our galaxy.

163
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:30,389
SEUM:
And, and this is found out by
the Andrea Ghez and she is given

164
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,828
SEUM:
Nobel Prize for it at twenty
twenty, I guess.

165
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,089
SEUM:
Sagittarius A almost, um, four

166
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,769
SEUM:
million times greater mass than

167
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,369
SEUM:
the sun.

168
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,969
SEUM:
Another way we can detect the

169
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,808
SEUM:
black holes using the

170
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,719
SEUM:
gravitational waves, which is a

171
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,668
SEUM:
modern approach.

172
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,989
SEUM:
And it's quite interesting that

173
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,788
SEUM:
Einstein predicted this at

174
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,349
SEUM:
nineteen sixteen.

175
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,749
SEUM:
And the first evidence for that

176
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:01,048
SEUM:
came into September fourteen,

177
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,749
SEUM:
twenty fifteen, and almost a

178
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:05,269
SEUM:
century after the Einstein

179
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,749
SEUM:
predicted that.

180
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:11,048
SEUM:
It's quite interesting what
happens, in the gravitational

181
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:14,969
SEUM:
waves that whenever two massive
objects like black hole comes in

182
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:18,808
SEUM:
contact to its gravitational
pull, they kind of rotates

183
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:24,009
SEUM:
around orbits, each each other,
and that creates a ripple in the

184
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,129
SEUM:
fabric of space time.

185
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:30,808
SEUM:
And the the ripples are the
waves in the fabric of space

186
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:37,308
SEUM:
time, kind of, um, creates the
space, shrinks and expands all

187
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:37,908
SEUM:
of a sudden.

188
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:43,053
SEUM:
And that's and that expansion
and the shrinks kind of can be

189
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:50,019
SEUM:
detected because you put lasers
and if it if it if it there, if

190
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,078
SEUM:
a gravitational wave passes by
and the space will kind of, um,

191
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:56,239
SEUM:
expand and shrinks down.

192
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,479
SEUM:
So you kind of the distance

193
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,698
SEUM:
between them will kind of, uh,

194
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,798
SEUM:
kind of oscillate And you can

195
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:07,538
SEUM:
detect that oscillation by using

196
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:09,698
SEUM:
laser or kind of something that

197
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:12,839
SEUM:
actually very, Sensitive to

198
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,639
SEUM:
small shifts And using that, we

199
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,918
SEUM:
can also detect the

200
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,038
SEUM:
gravitational.

201
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:21,399
SEUM:
Object that there is a collision

202
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,318
SEUM:
happening at this, at this mass

203
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,519
SEUM:
Because that amount of amplitude

204
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,019
SEUM:
only created by this amount of

205
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,969
SEUM:
massive object, we can find out

206
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:33,729
SEUM:
that there is a black hole or

207
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:35,408
SEUM:
not, or probably there is a

208
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,249
SEUM:
neutron star.

209
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:40,869
SEUM:
So using gravitational waves we
can also detect there is a black

210
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:41,869
SEUM:
hole or not.

211
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:45,828
SEUM:
In fact using gravitational
waves we can detect any massive

212
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:48,349
SEUM:
or any object that has a mass.

213
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:53,548
SEUM:
Um, it depends how sensitive our
instruments are to those waves.

214
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,188
SEUM:
So that's another way.

215
00:10:55,188 --> 00:11:03,068
SEUM:
Another way to detect black hole
is by massive object, um, which

216
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:04,908
SEUM:
is the gravitational lensing.

217
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,028
SEUM:
Whenever a massive objects is

218
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,649
SEUM:
there, space time is gets

219
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,369
SEUM:
curved, and that curvature of

220
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,729
SEUM:
space time creates a lensing

221
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:13,089
SEUM:
effect.

222
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,089
SEUM:
And that's why you see a black

223
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,389
SEUM:
hole and its other side kind of

224
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:19,129
SEUM:
warp And you see the accretion

225
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,438
SEUM:
disk is kind of orthogonally

226
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,058
SEUM:
painted at the two side and

227
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,499
SEUM:
other side.

228
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,418
SEUM:
Kind of can be seen.

229
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,458
SEUM:
So that's the gravitational
lensing.

230
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,458
SEUM:
And gravitational lensing can be
detected um, by our telescope.

231
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,298
SEUM:
The background is distorted this
way.

232
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:40,698
SEUM:
So there must be some kind of
massive object there.

233
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:45,099
SEUM:
So you can also find out, um, a
black hole by that to whenever

234
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:48,339
SEUM:
there is an there isn't an
accretion disk present or

235
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,139
SEUM:
something like that happens.

236
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,658
SEUM:
You can find out the black hole
presence.

237
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,778
SEUM:
Another thing happens at near a

238
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,418
SEUM:
black hole is that time

239
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:57,938
SEUM:
dilation.

240
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:02,859
SEUM:
I already mentioned that the
massive object curves, the any

241
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,259
SEUM:
object curves the system.

242
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,339
SEUM:
The massive object curves is
very much High So, uh, so

243
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,139
SEUM:
whenever you get to a close to a
black hole, your time will run

244
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,229
SEUM:
slow due to the curvature is
very significant here.

245
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:22,129
SEUM:
And another thing also happens
is spaghettification, um,

246
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:27,609
SEUM:
whenever you go near a black
hole, you kind of you're kind of

247
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:32,489
SEUM:
stressed, uh, in the vertical
direction and squeezed the

248
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:36,408
SEUM:
horizontal direction due to its
massive gravitational pull

249
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:40,649
SEUM:
difference difference between
your leg and your head.

250
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:41,889
SEUM:
So that kind of creates the

251
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,688
SEUM:
spaghettification at the, uh,

252
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:45,408
SEUM:
black hole.

253
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:46,328
SEUM:
At the black hole.

254
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,168
SEUM:
And another thing I want I
forgot to mention about the time

255
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:54,149
SEUM:
dilation is that, any object
creates a curvature of the space

256
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,649
SEUM:
in the space time actually
measured in earth because earth

257
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,928
SEUM:
has a gravitational field and
you go somewhere up, it's your

258
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:07,649
SEUM:
time is fast compared to the
people on the, the ground.

259
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:13,298
SEUM:
And this also experimented using
aircraft for the in the aircraft

260
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,979
SEUM:
there, or the atomic clock, and
that atomic clock and two

261
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,778
SEUM:
identical two identical atomic
clock is created.

262
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:25,538
SEUM:
And one at the ground atomic
clock actually run sometime some

263
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:31,739
SEUM:
very, uh, low some amount of
time slower than the the which

264
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,958
SEUM:
runs the at the airplane.

265
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:40,499
SEUM:
So that actually checks out that
the time shifts in the gravity

266
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,839
SEUM:
gravitational pull any object
that has a gravitational pull.

267
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,139
SEUM:
And that also happens the people
on the satellite, uh, ISIS uh,

268
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,558
SEUM:
have more, faster time going
than the people on the Earth.

269
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:57,438
SEUM:
So there's another So I talked a
lot about.

270
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,278
SEUM:
But I never forget one of the

271
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,438
SEUM:
more important thing that the

272
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,918
SEUM:
black hole.

273
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:07,119
SEUM:
Regardless, this is a very
extreme object in the universe.

274
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:12,798
SEUM:
It's quite simple, actually, and
because it has only three

275
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:17,599
SEUM:
properties, that is charge,
spin, and mass.

276
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,479
SEUM:
So that's only three properties

277
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,239
SEUM:
you need to describe any black

278
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,278
SEUM:
hole.

279
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:24,798
SEUM:
And.

280
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,359
SEUM:
These factor only decides how

281
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,678
SEUM:
many lifetime it will last, or

282
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:32,278
SEUM:
what will happen if there is

283
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,239
SEUM:
nothing to engulf by the black

284
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:35,558
SEUM:
hole.

285
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:39,339
SEUM:
So if not, even light can escape
the black hole.

286
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,538
SEUM:
Doesn't that mean that the black
hole will keep getting bigger

287
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:48,879
SEUM:
and bigger in size, as
everything is just going in, but

288
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,038
SEUM:
nothing comes out?

289
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:54,599
SEUM:
Then isn't black hole will live
forever.

290
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,038
SEUM:
It turns out that's not true.

291
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:01,318
SEUM:
In nineteen seventy four,
Stephen Hawking came up with the

292
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:06,359
SEUM:
concept of Hawking radiation,
and according to that, a black

293
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:12,038
SEUM:
hole also emits radiation and
its radiation is disproportional

294
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:13,078
SEUM:
with its mass.

295
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,519
SEUM:
This means that more massive
black hole is lesser the

296
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,078
SEUM:
radiation it will emit.

297
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,158
SEUM:
So, from at the at the end the

298
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,298
SEUM:
radiation emitted by a black

299
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:30,839
SEUM:
hole at its lifetime will be

300
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,339
SEUM:
exponential.

301
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,139
SEUM:
If it doesn't fit any more and
gets more massive than the black

302
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:43,698
SEUM:
hole will slowly start to emit
radiation and and with its mass

303
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:46,019
SEUM:
decreasing, it will radiate more
and more faster.

304
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,458
SEUM:
At the and at the end of its

305
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,918
SEUM:
lifetime, it will create a

306
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,298
SEUM:
spectacular bang.

307
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,519
SEUM:
And that's how the black hole

308
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,818
SEUM:
dies eventually, at the very

309
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,698
SEUM:
further and further of the

310
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,458
SEUM:
universe's lifetime.

311
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:08,339
SEUM:
And this is really bigger scale
of time we are talking about.

312
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,219
SEUM:
As everything falls into a black
hole.

313
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:17,298
SEUM:
It might seem like the
information is getting erased.

314
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:22,879
SEUM:
And according to the information
theory, no information cannot be

315
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,619
SEUM:
erased from the universe.

316
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:28,428
SEUM:
Or if you are not an information
theory fan.

317
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:31,908
SEUM:
Entropy of the universe cannot
be decreased.

318
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,769
SEUM:
For example, if you throw a

319
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,828
SEUM:
system like Earth which is very

320
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:39,788
SEUM:
disordered state, and throw it

321
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:42,249
SEUM:
into a black hole, it might seem

322
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,629
SEUM:
like that the entropy of the

323
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,908
SEUM:
universe lowered.

324
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:50,729
SEUM:
and according to the
thermodynamic principle, entropy

325
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:51,788
SEUM:
cannot be lowered.

326
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:54,509
SEUM:
So what happening?

327
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,908
SEUM:
What actually happening that
point.

328
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:59,629
SEUM:
And to preserve the information

329
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,269
SEUM:
theory and thermodynamic

330
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:02,349
SEUM:
principle.

331
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:09,229
SEUM:
Um, Gerard t Hooft and Leonard
Susskind, at probably nineteen

332
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:14,628
SEUM:
ninety, came up with the idea
that the black hole, the

333
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:19,719
SEUM:
information gate into black hole
actually is not lost.

334
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:25,878
SEUM:
They are encoded at the surface
of the black hole event horizon.

335
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,939
SEUM:
And that information will again

336
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,598
SEUM:
get shoot back with the Hawking

337
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,999
SEUM:
radiation.

338
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,798
SEUM:
That I described earlier.

339
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,759
SEUM:
And so information theory is
preserved.

340
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,398
SEUM:
In this way.

341
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:46,878
SEUM:
So that's it about the overview
of Black Hole.

342
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:52,398
SEUM:
And the next session I'm
probably going to discuss more

343
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:55,278
SEUM:
details of each stage.

344
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,098
SEUM:
For example, there's a lot to

345
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,479
SEUM:
learn about how black hole

346
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:03,358
SEUM:
formation happened and also the

347
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:04,878
SEUM:
Hawking radiation.

348
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,729
SEUM:
There's a lot to learn.

349
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:09,529
SEUM:
So I think I'm going to discuss
them later.

350
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,449
SEUM:
And until that, take care.

351
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:17,729
SEUM:
And consider supporting me if
you think my efforts are useful
